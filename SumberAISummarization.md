## Key Research Gaps and Opportunities

Through this comprehensive review, several critical research gaps emerge that your thesis directly addresses:

**Gap 1: Indonesian Financial NLP Integration** - No existing research combines Indonesian language NLP (RoBERTa, BERT-based NER) with financial domain-specific analysis. Your thesis bridges Indonesian NLP resources with financial sentiment analysis methodologies.

**Gap 2: Telegram-Specific Summarization Systems** - Limited academic work exists on automated summarization specifically for Telegram bot applications, despite extensive research on Telegram communities and general social media summarization.

**Gap 3: Real-Time Multi-Model NLP Pipelines** - Few papers demonstrate integrated systems combining sentiment analysis, NER, topic modeling, and LLM-based summarization in real-time event-driven architectures for messaging platforms.

**Gap 4: Tiered Community Information Management** - No research addresses hierarchical information flow and automated summarization across tiered community groups—your multi-level Telegram group architecture represents novel contribution.

**Gap 5: Hourly Financial Discussion Synthesis** - While dynamic topic modeling and streaming NLP exist separately, their combination for hourly financial discussion summarization in non-English social media represents unexplored territory.
